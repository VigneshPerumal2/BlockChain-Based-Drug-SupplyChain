# **MEDICINE TRACKING SYSTEM**

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

A comprehensive, end-to-end track and trace system is essential for pharmaceutical supply chains, according to existing studies.
To ensure product safety and get rid of fakes, the pharmaceutical supply chain needs a comprehensive product tracking system. 
Since most track and trace systems are currently centralized, healthcare supply chains face problems with data privacy, openness, and authenticity.
In this project, we outline a strategy for effective product tracing in the healthcare supply chain. 
This ensures data provenance, which does away with the need for middlemen and gives everyone access to a safe, unchangeable history of transactions. 
The operating principles of the suggested solution are governed by the system architecture. 
We test and validate the system, and then offer a cost and security analysis to determine how well it can improve traceability inside pharmaceutical supply chains.

# **PHARMACY SUPPLY CHAIN**

The pharmacy supply chain refers to the network of organizations, activities, and resources involved in the production, distribution, and sale of drugs and other medical products. This can include manufacturers of raw materials and ingredients, pharmaceutical companies that develop and produce drugs, wholesalers and distributors who transport the drugs to pharmacies and other retail outlets, and pharmacies and other retail outlets that dispense the drugs to patients. The pharmacy supply chain is a complex and highly regulated system, and it is critical to the availability of safe and effective drugs to patients. Effective management of the pharmacy supply chain can help ensure that the right drugs are delivered to the right place at the right time, while also minimizing costs and waste.
