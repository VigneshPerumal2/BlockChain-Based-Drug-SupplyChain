# **MEDICINE TRACKING SYSTEM**

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

A comprehensive, end-to-end track and trace system is essential for pharmaceutical supply chains, according to existing studies.
To ensure product safety and get rid of fakes, the pharmaceutical supply chain needs a comprehensive product tracking system. 
Since most track and trace systems are currently centralized, healthcare supply chains face problems with data privacy, openness, and authenticity.
In this project, we outline a strategy for effective product tracing in the healthcare supply chain. 
This ensures data provenance, which does away with the need for middlemen and gives everyone access to a safe, unchangeable history of transactions. 
The operating principles of the suggested solution are governed by the system architecture. 
We test and validate the system, and then offer a cost and security analysis to determine how well it can improve traceability inside pharmaceutical supply chains.
